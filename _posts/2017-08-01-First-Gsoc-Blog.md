title: A brief introduction to Donor Workflow Management Application
author: Saurabh Singh
---

This project was envisaged in order to provide developers and volunteers with a one-stop- solution for managing and tracking donations and details of prospective donors for the SphinxCapt project at CMU. The project included a leaderboard of Donor, which is our special way of thanking donors who are supporting the project. The project also provides a workflow to the project members and volunteers to log telephonic and email correspondence with all donors.

## What does the project encompass? 
-----

The Donor Workflow Management Application came up as a requirement for managing Donors for the SphinxCapt Project. Since the project involved approaching a large number of donors to raise money to purchase Amazon Mechanical Turk Credit which are required for processing voice samples manually by paid workforce. 

The Workflow encompasses all activities required by volunteers, supervisors and administrators during the course of raising donation money. These involved the following:
    
    * Registration of New Donors
    * Allocation of Volunteers for each prospective donor
    * Logging of Telephone and Email conversation with Donors
    * Freezing Commitment of Donations by Donors
    * Accounting and Receipt Generation of Credited Donations
    * User and Right Management
    * Bulk Email Messaging
    * Other Wanted Features (We shall discover as we go along)
