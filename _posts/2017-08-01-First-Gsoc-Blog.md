Brief Introduction
---
The Donor Workflow Management Application came up as a requirement for managing Donors for the SphinxCapt Project. Since the project  involved approaching a large number of donors to raise money to purchase Amazon Mechanical Turk Credit which are required for processing voice samples manually by paid workforce.
The Workflow encompasses all activities required by volunteers, supervisors and administrators during the course of raising donation money. These involved the following:
    * Registration of New Donors
    * Allocation of Volunteers for each prospective donor
    * Logging of Telephone and Email conversation with Donors
    * Freezing Commitment of Donations by Donors
    * Accounting and Receipt Generation of Credited Donations
    * User and Right Management
    * Bulk Email Messaging
    * Other Wanted Features (We shall discover as we go along)

More details of the project are available on the [Github Page](https://github.com/saurabhima/gsoc_LEADERBOARD)
