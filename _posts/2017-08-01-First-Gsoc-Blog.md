author: Saurabh Singh

This project was envisaged in order to provide developers and volunteers with a one-stop- solution for managing and tracking donations and details of prospective donors for the SphinxCapt project at CMU. The project included a leaderboard of Donor, which is our special way of thanking donors who are supporting the project. The project also provides a workflow to the project members and volunteers to log telephonic and email correspondence with all donors.

## What does the project encompass?

The Donor Workflow Management Application came up as a requirement for managing Donors for the SphinxCapt Project. Since the project involved approaching a large number of donors to raise money to purchase Amazon Mechanical Turk Credit which are required for processing voice samples manually by paid workforce.
