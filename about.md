I am currently a second year Masters student in the Computer Science Department of Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I am interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and love to use these tools to solve real world problems. I have worked on several projects in this domain including Information Retrival and Natural Language Processing,  

I am also interested in Embedded Systems, Robotics and am a Maker Enthusiast who love to fabricate and develop new things for fun. I am a trained Ball Room dancer and love Equestrian Sports (Horse Riding). I am also a trained Ultralight Pilot and dream of owning my own Ultralight someday.
